1. Load Barrier from file. (eg. XML)
2. We need an editor to edit barrier file and of course importer for that is also demanded.
Something reference: SpriteHelper + LevelHelper, but they r charging money.

3. Paramerize the bricks/enemies data in file described above.

4. Consider a mask shader for the bricks broking effect.
5. Apply particle effect to the fonts.
	+ Shows barrier count.
	
	Apply TTF to app
	Reference: 
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4228644/using-custom-fonts-in-cocos2d
	
	added ttf file to info.plist and apply it in code.
	fonts resouce: http://www.urbanfonts.com/
	
	ccc3 Example Colors:

	white - (255,255,255)

	black - (0,0,0)

	blue - (0,0,255)

	green- (0,255,0)

	red - (255,0,0)

	Grey – (84,84,84)

	Brown – (165,42,42)

	Pink – (255,192,203)

	Purple – (160,32,240)

	Yellow – (255,255,0)

	Gold – (255,215,0)

6. Animation object abstract. I have to place them in a new class to perform.

7. Sound effect system is not applied at all.

8. Shop and Skill UI.

9. Add wind effect within gravity? 

10. If we want break something into serval pieces. Check this sample:
	TestBreakable.as in box2d within function Broke.

11. About collide:
	If the fixture never needs to collide with anything you could make it a sensor. If you need it to collide with some things but not others you could do contact->SetEnabled(false) in the PreSolve of the collision listener, depending on what it collided with.
	
12. Trajectory:

13. Somehing about Box2D to reference:
	box2d robe elastic
	http://box2d.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=8379

	sample
	http://box2dflash.sourceforge.net/
	

	不一定要elastic robe，可以用手指推出，还可以连续touch，快速发射，以及蓄气发射
	另外，touch point不需要是bullet，可以是魔法阵，蓄气的话，会变大变红，快速发射的话...
